	<h3> 2. France </h3>
	<hr>
	<p>If it weren't for France, there probably wouldn't be much beauty in the world. The magnificent landscapes of Provence inspired artists to their best paintings,
		 slim and slender Parisian women brought fashion into a cult and showed everyone what true chic and elegance is, and France has given the world many famous writers and architects.
		 And if not for Paris, it would not be the most beautiful and romantic capital for lovers. That is why it is impossible to imagine our planet without France. 
		 Probably most people at least once in their lives had an irresistible desire to visit this fabulous country, and rightly so. 
		 A country of wonderful music, delicious cheese, perfect wine and intoxicating aromas.</p>

	<h3> 3. Poland </h3>
	<hr>
	<p>It seems that Poland is somewhere very close, and that life there is somewhat reminiscent of ours. However, this opinion seems to be wrong, and to be sure, 
		you need to urgently go to Poland! In Poland, you will be surprised by a completely different architecture, a truly European way of life, unique traditions and cuisine. 
		All of the above will pleasantly surprise you and make you return to this country again and again. 
		The resort regions of the country are divided into two parts: in the north - beaches and the sea, in the south - healing and mineral springs and ski slopes. 
		Somewhere in the middle are the sights of Warsaw, Teutonic castles, ancient Krakow, Poznan and Lodz, the Masurian Lakes. All these places can be explored endlessly.</p>

	<h3> 4. Hungary </h3>
	<hr>
	<p>If you haven't been to Hungary, you just haven't eaten the world's most delicious meat dishes, and not only, 
		haven't sung to your favorite band at one of Europe's oldest music festivals, seen the world's most beautiful parliament, or enjoyed one of the most melodic languages. 
		Walking the ancient streets. Goulash, pancake, Tokaj wine and other innovations of Hungarian cuisine simply whet the appetite and delight the soul, 
		beautiful and stylish architecture makes your head spin, the mighty and fast Danube makes you think about the eternal, 
		and friendly and hospitable Hungarians are happy to suggest interesting and non-trivial places!</p>
